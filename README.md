# Repo with some random stuff

As i was (and still am) learning to code, i have made (and sometimes straight up copied) several little programs to check stuff, get some cool famous results, and visualize cool curves. Some stuff here are recent, while other are years old.


## List with some of the stuff you can find here:
1. 'Pet park' i made to learn a bit about [Object Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)
2. A terminal-based visualizer for a random-walk. 
3. Lots of random math stuff (added just a few of them)
	1. Approximating $\pi$ with 'darts'
	2. Approximating $e$ with its series representation
	3. Computing the value of the Basel problem
	4. Getting the roots of polynomials using the [Bisection Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method)
	5. Computing the probability of cutting in between two candles on a cake (from [this Numberphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkVe8qrT0LA))
	6. Integration with [Riemann Summation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sum)
	7. Visualizing [Lissajous Curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_curve)
	8. [Monte Carlo Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_integration) of functions
	9. Calculating Pi using [Wallis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallis_product)
	10. [Poisson Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution)
	11. Prime number sieve (using generators and [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes))
	12. Sum of cubes is equal to sum of naturals squared (Sum($n^3$) = (Sum(n))$^2$)
